# E. Slayton Application for NEH Humanities Data Scientist 

### Introduction to Application

For Decades the National Endowment for the Humanities has focused on supporting research that brings humanistic perspectives to 
 

### Open Access for Open Humanities




### Open Data and Humanities for Communities 


### The Ethics of Access and Privacy surounding with Open Data 
- layers of audience openess
- Who is the audience
- privacy concerns / how are we ensuring openness is equitable - who can access but also what the data is about
- access / ethics / privacy
- nock on effect is evaluating data managmaent for open and ethical and accessible not currently present but something to look for
- -- tied to AI and ML drawing from public data sets / how we create algorithms that are ethical 


### Connecting Projects to Congressional Interests 



As the reviwed NEH projects are all dependent on funding provided by congress, congressional audiences may also be inerterested 


### Exploration of the NEH Data 

In order to conduct a breif evaluation NEH project data evalaute if any focused on engaging communities through the use of 'Open' resources, I wanted to isolate specifics related to the terms 'Open' 

Challanges in evaluating the open nature of these projects comes in the lack of available project description from the NEH_Grants1990s file. However, we may assume that due to the earlier record of these grant awards - being assigned not later than 2000 and finished no later than 2013, that not all grants were carried out during a period with the same level of supports for open access to materials and access to digital tools or digital literacies. 

Though this project begins to explore the relationship between Open Data, Open Access Resources, and community interests existing in NEH projects, it would be impossible to conduct a full evaluation in the short timeframe provided for this work.

** Tableau **








** Open Refine **

Processes in Open Refine include managing columns through column splitting. This was achieved by using the column drop down > Edit Columns > Split into several columns. 

### Data Managment Plan 

The data for this project can be accessed through the github page assocaited with this project and maintained by Emma Slayton. 

Data will be maintained for a minimum of one year post the submision deadline (September 16th, 2023). 

File types assocaietd with this project include R files (produced using RStudio 2022.07.1+554) and .tbx files for use in Tabealu software (produced with Tableau 2022.2), as well as .csv and .txt files.
