# Application for NEH Humanities Data Scientist 

### Introduction to Application




## Open Access for Open Humanities



Challanges in evaluating the open nature of these projects comes in the lack of available project description from the NEH_Grants1990s file. However, we may assume that due to the earlier record of these grant awards - being assigned not later than 2000 and finished no later than 2013, that not all grants were carried out during a period with the same level of supports for open access to materials and access to digital tools or digital literacies.
