# Application for NEH Humanities Data Scientist 

### Introduction to Application


### Open Access for Open Humanities




### Open Data and Humanities for Communities 



### Exploration of the NEH Data 

Challanges in evaluating the open nature of these projects comes in the lack of available project description from the NEH_Grants1990s file. However, we may assume that due to the earlier record of these grant awards - being assigned not later than 2000 and finished no later than 2013, that not all grants were carried out during a period with the same level of supports for open access to materials and access to digital tools or digital literacies. 


### The Ethics of Access and Privacy surounding with Open Data 
- layers of audience openess
- Who is the audience
- privacy concerns / how are we ensuring openness is equitable - who can access but also what the data is about
- access / ethics / privacy
- nock on effect is evaluating data managmaent for open and ethical and accessible not currently present but something to look for
- -- tied to AI and ML drawing from public data sets / how we create algorithms that are ethical
